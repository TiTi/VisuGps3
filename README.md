This is the next version of [VisuGps](https://github.com/vicb/VisuGps), one of my
first web project. It has been rewritten to leverage the latest JS API form Google
as the maps API v2 will be deprecated in 2013.

## Supported features

- The track can be viewed in 3D on platforms where the [GE plugin is supported](http://www.google.com/earth/explore/products/plugin.html),
- Display markers for routes,
- Measure distances with the path plugin,
- Display IGN maps for France.
